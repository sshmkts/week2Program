# week2Program
This program is called Single-Match Player Tracker (Week 2).
It asks the user to enter a soccer player’s name, number of goals, assists, and minutes played.
The program checks if the input is valid, then calculates the player’s performance — impact and goals + assists per 90 minutes.
It shows a clear match summary on the screen and also saves the same report to a file named report.txt.
